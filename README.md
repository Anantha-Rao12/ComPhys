# Computational Physics (PHY453) NPTEL

This repository contains the assignments and solutions for the 3-credit Computational Physics (PHY453) course as part of my Major at IISER Pune. Video lectures of an older version of the same course is available on the National Programme on Technology Enhanced Learning (NPTEL) platform and can be viewed [here](https://nptel.ac.in/courses/115/106/115106118/). The course includes different modules dedicated to solving major problems in physics numerically.

All code for problems are written in fortran95. We then use python and xmgrace for plotting and analysis. I have shared the assignments, my code to solve the problem, and the submiited files along with a README.pdf for each assignment.
